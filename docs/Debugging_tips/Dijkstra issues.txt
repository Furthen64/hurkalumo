1st		Draw the Graph on a piece of paper

		So you can go over and check distances easily.
	


2nd		Check the Graph

		Make sure the Graph is constructed as you'd like it to be.


3rd		Change the graph around , see if it works sometimes or all the times
		Maybe its a matter of how the graph is

4th		Follow Dijkstra 
		Step by step on paper... see where it does something awkward
