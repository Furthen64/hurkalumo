HELLO

If you want to contribute to this wonky and brittle game, which is just an engine (2018-04)... it'd probably be best if you branch something and if you commit stuff to Master  or merge to Master branch, please oh GOD please make sure it compiles and runs.

I would appreciate it ! 
Thank you kind person reading this <3
