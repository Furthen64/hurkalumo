Hurkalumo is a game that will resemble OpenTTD but be more storydriven, helping out communities, managing the railroad.
Below you can see some of the progress of alpha-0.1

2018-06: I'm currently working with the core functionality, making it more solid. Also realizing how much I want to change. Ah well, gonna save that labor of love for alpha-0.2 next year. The next months I'll probably be spending with Load/Save file and making test cases, tightening up FIXMEs, all that boring stuff that will be a massive headache if I don't adress it now.

2018-05: The Dijkstra algorithm is up and running, buses can find the optimal path from A to B and even care about congestion if I ever add that data to the roads. 

2018-04: Lots of time spent on behind-the-scenes things. High level structure of the editor, Route algorithms for the buses, Traffic Manager. Getting it right, ripe and ready!

# Structural wishlist for the future
Add some pointer manager, maybe use Boost
